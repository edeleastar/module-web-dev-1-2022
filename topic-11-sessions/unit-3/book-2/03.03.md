# Routes

These forms require these additional routes:

## conf/routes

~~~bash
GET    /signup                                  Accounts.signup
GET    /login                                   Accounts.login
POST   /register                                Accounts.register
POST   /authenticate                            Accounts.authenticate
GET    /logout                                  Accounts.logout
~~~


Make sure to place these additional route towards the top of the file:

~~~
# Home page
GET     /                                       Start.index

GET    /signup                                  Accounts.signup
GET    /login                                   Accounts.login
POST   /register                                Accounts.register
POST   /authenticate                            Accounts.authenticate
GET    /logout                                  Accounts.logout
...
~~~

Run the application now - and sign up 2 users and log in as each user in turn. Experiment with the various forms.

Do you notice the slightly odd behaviour? We seem to have a single playlist - regardless of who is logged in.

Clearly this is not what we intended - each user should have their own playlist, separate from other users. We will tackle this in the next step.
