# Sessions - Dashboard

This is the current version of the Dashboard controller:

~~~java
package controllers;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import models.Playlist;
import models.Song;
import play.Logger;
import play.mvc.Controller;

public class Dashboard extends Controller
{
  public static void index() 
  {
    Logger.info("Rendering Admin");
    
    List<Playlist> playlists = Playlist.findAll();
    render ("dashboard.html", playlists);
  }

  public static void deletePlaylist (Long id)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Logger.info ("Removing" + playlist.title);
    playlist.delete();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }

  public static void addPlaylist (String title)
  {
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist (title, 0);
    Logger.info ("Adding a new playlist called " + title);
    playlist.save();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }
}
~~~

In the above, there is no reference to the currently logged in user - a single global collection of playlists is manipulated.

Replace this controller with the following version:

## Dashboard.java

~~~java
package controllers;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import models.Member;
import models.Playlist;
import models.Song;
import play.Logger;
import play.mvc.Controller;

public class Dashboard extends Controller
{
  public static void index() 
  {
    Logger.info("Rendering Dasboard");
    Member member = Accounts.getLoggedInMember();
    List<Playlist> playlists = member.playlists;
    render ("dashboard.html", playlists);
  }

  public static void deletePlaylist (Long id)
  {
    Logger.info("Deleting a Playlist");
    Member member = Accounts.getLoggedInMember();
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    member.playlists.remove(playlist);
    member.save();
    playlist.delete();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }

  public static void addPlaylist (String title)
  {
    Logger.info("Adding a Playlist");
    Member member = Accounts.getLoggedInMember();
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist (title, 0);
    member.playlists.add(playlist);
    member.save();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }
}
~~~

This is modeled on the equivalent controller in the Todolist-2 application. Each controller method always carries out the following:

- Log a suitable message
- Get the currently logged in member
- Manipulate that members playlists


Run the application now again, and verify that you can create and delete playlists. Keep a note of the names of the playlists you create for a given user - and switch users a few times. Verify that you are only manipulating the playlists for the logged in user.
