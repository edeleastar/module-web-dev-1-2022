Without making any changes to this class, log in as 2 different users, and populate a few playlists for each. Verify that when you switch users that the playlists are always appropriate to the logged in user.

Consider the following questions:

- (1) Why do we not need a reference to the currently logged in user in this class?
- (2) Could we trigger a route leading to one of these methods without logging in at all?
- (3) If (2) is possible, how could we prevent this happening?
