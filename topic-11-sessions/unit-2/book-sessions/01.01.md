# Setup

The starting point for this lab is the solutions to the Todo List app from the last lab. You will need to have completed these exercises in order to proceed.

If you still have some exercises not completed, then perhaps download this solution here:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2020/todolist/releases/tag/todolist-1.exercises>

and import into Idea as we have described in earlier labs. This solution includes:

- Exercise 1: Yaml + Bootstrap
- Exercise 2: Tables
- Exercise 3: Delete button
- Exercise 4: Delete Implementation
- Exercise 5: Admin Feature

Review each of these exercises, and make sure you can follow the essentials of the implementation.
