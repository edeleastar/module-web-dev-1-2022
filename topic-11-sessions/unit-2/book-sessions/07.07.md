# Current User

To complete the app, a new method in the Accounts controller:

## app/controller/Accounts.java

~~~java
...
  public static Member getLoggedInMember()
  {
    Member member = null;
    if (session.contains("logged_in_Memberid")) {
      String memberId = session.get("logged_in_Memberid");
      member = Member.findById(Long.parseLong(memberId));
    } else {
      login();
    }
    return member;
  }
...
~~~

The Dashoard index method can now be updated:

## app/controllers/Dashboard.java

~~~java
...
  public static void index()
  {
    Logger.info("Rendering Dashboard");
    Member member = Accounts.getLoggedInMember();
    List<Todo> todolist = member.todolist;
    render("dashboard.html", member, todolist);
  }
...  
~~~

Notice how we are changing how we retrieve the todos. Also, we are not passing `member` as well as `todolist` to the view.

We also need a new version of the `addTodo` method:

~~~java
  public static void addTodo(String title)
  {
    Member member = Accounts.getLoggedInMember();
    Todo todo = new Todo(title);
    member.todolist.add(todo);
    member.save();
    Logger.info("Adding Todo" + title);
    redirect("/dashboard");
  }
~~~

We can make use of the `member` in the dashboard view, replacing the header with the following:

## app/views/dashboard.html

~~~html
...
  <header class="ui header">
    ${member.firstname} ${member.lastname}'s Todo List
  </header>
...
~~~

Restart the app now - and as different member, create some todos. Make sure that each member only sees his/her own todos.

We might also change the data.yml file to associate the todos with the members:

## conf/data.yml

~~~yaml
Todo(t1):
  title: Make tea

Todo(t2):
  title: Go for snooze

Todo(t3):
  title: Make more tea

Member(m1):
  firstname: homer
  lastname: simpson
  email: homer@simpson.com
  password: secret
  todolist:
  - t1
  - t2

Member(m2):
  firstname: marge
  lastname: simpson
  email: marge@simpson.com
  password: secret
  todolist:
  - t3
~~~

Restart the app, and verify that the indicated todos are visible when the user logs in.
