# Signup

Review our signup form, and notice the action the form triggers:


## app/views/signup.html

~~~html
...
    <form class="ui stacked segment form" action="/register" method="POST">
...
~~~

We now implement this route:

## conf/routes

~~~bash
POST   /register                                Accounts.register
~~~

and here is the implementation of the matching action in the `Accounts` controller:


## app/controllers/Accounts.java

~~~java
...
  public static void register(String firstname, String lastname, String email, String password)
  {
    Logger.info("Registering new user " + email);
    Member member = new Member(firstname, lastname, email, password);
    member.save();
    redirect("/");
  }
...  
~~~

Restart the app now - and try the signup form. Register a new Member. Explore the database to see if the Member is actually created in the members table.
