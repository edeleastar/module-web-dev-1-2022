# Login & Logout

Now for the login form - a new route:

## conf/routes

~~~bash
POST   /authenticate                            Accounts.authenticate
~~~

## app/controllers/Accounts.java

~~~java
...
  public static void authenticate(String email, String password)
  {
    Logger.info("Attempting to authenticate with " + email + ":" + password);

    Member member = Member.findByEmail(email);
    if ((member != null) && (member.checkPassword(password) == true)) {
      Logger.info("Authentication successful");
      session.put("logged_in_Memberid", member.id);
      redirect ("/dashboard");
    } else {
      Logger.info("Authentication failed");
      redirect("/login");
    }
  }
...  
~~~

Restart the app now, and try to log in. If you try with one of the preloaded user details, you should be in to the dashboard.

If you try to logout, you get a 404. We can now implement this as well:

## conf/routes

~~~bash
GET    /logout                                  Accounts.logout
~~~

## app/controllers/Accounts.java

~~~java
...
  public static void logout()
  {
    session.clear();
    redirect ("/");
  }
...  
~~~

We should now be able to log in and log out.

Try the following:

- Log in as Homer, and create some todos
- Log out
- Log in as Marge - what todos are presented when marge logs in?


You might notice that the same todos are presented to each member. Clearly there is something wrong here - we should be segmenting them per user.
