# Install Git


Git is an essential tool for all developers - as is a github account. 

Check if your systems already has git installed:


~~~bash
git --version
~~~

The system might respond with something like this:

~~~bash
git version 2.20.1.windows.1
~~~

If not, install git for your platform:

Accept all the default options if they are presented. To verify the install, try the version command above.

We will be learning more about git later in the course - and using it will become part of your daily routine when developing almost any project. We will explore its features gradually as we need them.
