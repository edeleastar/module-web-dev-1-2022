# Images

Currently our images are not being resized proportionally at all. Semantic UI has a range of image features:

Open the sidebar and extend the image elements to have a new class 'ui image'

### sidebar.njk

~~~html
...
  <img src="/images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle" class="ui image">
...
 <img src="/images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal" class="ui image"> With
...
~~~

The images are now resized to something more proportional to the context:

We can also impose some shape on the images:

- <https://fomantic-ui.com/elements/image.html#circular>

Try this:

~~~html
...
  <img src="/images/business.png" alt="Business Bundle" class="ui circular image">
...
  <img src="/images/insanity.jpg" alt="Insanity Deal" class="ui circular image">
...
~~~
