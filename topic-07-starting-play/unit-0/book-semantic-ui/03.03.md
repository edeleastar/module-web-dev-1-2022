# Grid

We have carefully used the new grid CSS standard in our project, but have now removed it to use Semantic UI. This framework has its own grid system:

- <https://fomantic-ui.com/collections/grid.html>

This is somewhat simpler to master, and has a number of features our implementation did not address.

Here is how we might revise `index.html` (not showing the contents of the article and the aside):

### layout.njk

~~~html
  ...
      <section class="ui grid">
        <section class="ui twelve wide column">
          {% include "nav.njk" %}      
          {{ content | safe }}
        </section>
        <aside class="ui four wide column">
          {% include "sidebar.njk" %}
        </aside>
      </section>
  ...
~~~

We are using the 16 column grid system defined by Semantic-UI - and defining a 12 - 4 ratio between our main article and the included aside.

The page should look like this now:

This is the complete layout file:

### layout.njk
