# Model

Revise the Model classes, by changing the structure of both to these versions:

## app/models/Song.java

~~~java
package models;

import javax.persistence.Entity;

import play.db.jpa.Model;

@Entity
public class Song extends Model
{
  public String title;
  public String artist;
  public int duration;
  
  public Song(String title, String artist, int duration)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.artist = artist;
    this.duration = duration;
  }
}
~~~

## app/models/Playlist.java

~~~java
package models;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import javax.persistence.CascadeType;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.OneToMany;

import play.db.jpa.Model;

@Entity
public class Playlist extends Model
{
  public String title;
  @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  public List<Song> songs = new ArrayList<Song>();
  public int duration;

  public Playlist(String title, int duration)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.duration = duration;
  }
}
~~~

These versions are largely the same as the ones we have overwritten, except that there are a number of additional `annotations`:

~~~java
...
@Entity
...
@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
...
~~~

The purpose of these is to associate these classes with a Database.
