# Delete Song 2

This is our deleteSong method:

~~~java
  public static void deletesong (Long id, Long songid)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Song song = Song.findById(songid);
    Logger.info ("Removing" + song.title);

    render("playlist.html", playlist);
  }
~~~

Note that we have 2 ids:

- id of the playlist
- id of the song in the playlist (songid)

These ids are generated by this link:

~~~html
 <a href="/playlists/${playlist.id}/deletesong/${song.id}" class="ui tiny red button">Delete Song</a>
~~~

And are interpreted by this route:

~~~markdown
GET     /playlists/{id}/deletesong/{songid}     PlaylistCtrl.deleteSong
~~~

Follow carefully the `id` and `songid` identifiers in the above.

To actually delete the song, we need to remove it from the playlist songs collection + delete from the database:

~~~java
  public static void deletesong (Long id, Long songid)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Song song = Song.findById(songid);
    Logger.info ("Removing" + song.title);
    playlist.songs.remove(song);
    playlist.save();
    song.delete();
    render("playlist.html", playlist);
  }
~~~


Try this now - and make sure the songs are removed. Also, check that they are removed from the database table.
