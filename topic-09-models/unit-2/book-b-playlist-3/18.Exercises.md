As usual, the exercises below will be solved in the next lab. Have a go at them if you have time, even if you only partially complete them.

## Exercise 2: UX Enhancements

Introduce a 'Delete Playlist' button for each playlist, represented by a `trash` icon. E.g:

![](img/06.png)

In addition, the `view` link is replace by a `folder open` icon. You can learn how to use these icons in Fomantic UI here:

- <https://fomantic-ui.com/elements/icon.html>

Bind the `delete playlist` button to a new function to be implemented in the Dashboard controller, which should log the id of the playlist to be deleted.

## Exercise 3: Delete Playlist Functionality

Make the button actually delete the denoted playlist.
