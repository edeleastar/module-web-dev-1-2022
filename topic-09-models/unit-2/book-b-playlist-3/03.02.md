# Router + Controller

The starting point for any new link in our app is to first define a `route` to support this link. All supported routes are defined in `config/conf`

## config/conf

~~~markdown
# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# 

# Home page
GET     /                                       Start.index
GET     /dashboard                              Dashboard.index
GET     /about                                  About.index
GET     /admin                                  Admin.index

# Ignore favicon requests
GET     /favicon.ico                            404

# Map static resources from the /app/public folder to the /public path
GET     /public/                                staticDir:public

# Catch all
*       /{controller}/{action}                  {controller}.{action}
~~~

In particular, these are the main routes currently supported:

~~~markdown
GET     /                                       Start.index
GET     /dashboard                              Dashboard.index
GET     /about                                  About.index
GET     /admin                                  Admin.index
~~~

These are the three patterns our app responds to: 

- `/`
- `/dashboard`
- `/about`
- `/admin`

Any other pattern will generate a `not found` error from our app.

Also note that each of these statements matches a route pattern with a function inside a controller. So, for instance, this route:

~~~
GET     /about                                  About.index
~~~

... ensures that this function would be called if the route was triggered:

~~~js
public class About extends Controller
{
  public static void index() {
    Logger.info("Rendering about");
    render ("about.html");
  }
}
~~~

Reflect on this connection for a moment before proceeding.
