Select the Create button from the toolbar and locate the folder containing the project we have just created:

Press Create - and select Yes in the subsequent dialog:

Sourcetree will now be configured as shown:

We can now 'stage' all of the sources in the project by pressing the 'Stage All' button:

With the configuration as shown above, enter a short message 'template play project' as shown:

Press 'Commit' and the Source tree will be configured like this:

This seems a complex, but the process is always the same:

- Stage: this is selecting which files to be added (or which changed files are to be added)
- Commit Message: a easily readable short message
- Commit : bind the changes + commit message and update the repository
