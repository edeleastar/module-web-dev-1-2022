In the subsequent dialog, tick the checkbox next to 'master', and then press push. This will transfer a copy of the local files in the repository to the copy on github.

The 'local' and 'remote' repositories are now linked - and changes we make locally we will need to explicitly push a 'commit' of new additions as we make them.
