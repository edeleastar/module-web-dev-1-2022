## Logs

Back in the Heroku Console - select `more` on the top right:

Select `View logs`.

This is the equivalent of the console when you were running the app locally on your workstation. When testing the deployed application it is useful to always keep this view open. It enables you to monitor the application, identify potential errors and generally keep an eye on its operation.

You now have 2 versions of the source of your application

- The version you are developing using IDEA
- A copy of the application on a synced to github.


### Running Locally

If you wish to run the app locally only (say with out an internet connection), then you will need to reverse the change you made re the database in the config file:

### conf/application.conf

~~~
db.default=mem
#db=postgres://iwbagwwl:2DWjtsdfgsfgsdfgI1revvB3@tai.db.elephantsql.com:5432/iwbagwwl
#jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
#jpa.ddl=update
~~~

In the above, we commented out the last three entries, and brought back in the `mem` database. Be careful not to push this to GitHub however.
