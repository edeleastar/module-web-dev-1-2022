# Play Database

### Limit Bootstrap 

Currently our Bootstrap class will `seed` the database every time the app launches. This is fine for the in-memory database we have been using. However as we are now preparing to deploy to a persistent database, we should only seed the database if it is empty, otherwise the application will populate the database with duplicates. This is a revised version of `Bootstrap` that will do this:

#### app/Bootstrap.java

~~~java
import java.util.List;

import play.*;
import play.jobs.*;
import play.test.*;

import models.*;

@OnApplicationStart
public class Bootstrap extends Job
{
  public void doJob()
  {
    if (Member.count() == 0)
    {
      Fixtures.loadModels("data.yml");
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Configuration 

Locate this in the application.conf file:

#### app/conf/application.conf

~~~bash
db.default=mem
~~~

Using the database in your clipboard, paste it in instead of the `men` entry (keeping `db=`)

~~~bash
db=postgres://iwbagwwl:2DWjtsdfgsfgsdfgI1revvB3@tai.db.elephantsql.com:5432/iwbagwwl
~~~

Add the following entries immediately after the above:

~~~bash
jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
jpa.ddl=update
~~~

Save and restart the application. Notice that in the console we should see something like this:

~~~bash
13:31:48,504 INFO  ~ Connected to jdbc:postgresql://tai.db.elephantsql.com:5432/iwbagwwl for default
~~~

Your app is now running on your own workstation - but connected to a database hosted in the cloud.

We can inspect the database - select Table Queries and select a table:

This will generate a query:

Which will populate a table of the database contents:

This is equivalent to the in memory database browser we have been using - except the database is in the cloud.

Our next step is to get this application source itself into the cloud using Heroku.
