# Playlist Branding

We are going to evolve this project into a simple playlist maker, enabling a user to create a playlist of songs.

First, we can make some simple changes to rebrand the app as `Playlist` instead of `Template 1`

Edit the following files and make the changes as shown:

## views/tags/menu.html

~~~html
...
  <header class="ui header item"> <a href="/"> Playlist </a></header>
...
~~~

## views/about.html

~~~html
...
<p>
  A Little Playlist Maker - Version 1
</p>
...
~~~

## views/start.html

~~~html
...
<h1 class="ui header">
  Welcome to Playlist 1
</h1>
<p>
  A small app to let you compose playlists.
</p>
...
~~~

Run the app (it may be still running). Check out the new 'branding'. Make sure the menu operates as expected.
