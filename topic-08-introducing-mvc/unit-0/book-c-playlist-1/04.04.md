# Static Playlist

In this step we will start to display the playlist itself. First, introduce new partial called `listsongs.html`:

## views/tags/listsongs.html

~~~html
<table class="ui fixed table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Song</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      </td>
      <td>
      </td>
  </tbody>
</table>
~~~

Now change the dashboard view to include this partial:

## views/dashboard.html

~~~html
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Dashboard' /}

#{menu id:"dashboard"/}

<section class="ui segment">
  <h2 class="ui header">
    Playlist Title
  </h2>
  #{listsongs/}
</section>
~~~

Make sure the app runs successfully. The table will be empty.

To test out the UX, we might include some actual songs (replace the `<tbody>` of listsongs with the following):

## views/tags/listsongs.html

~~~html
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Piano Sonata No. 3
    </td>
    <td>
      Beethoven
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Piano Sonata No. 7
    </td>
    <td>
      Beethoven
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Piano Sonata No. 10
    </td>
    <td>
      Beethoven
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
~~~

... and also give the playlist a title in dashboard:

## views/dashboard.html

~~~html
....
  <h2 class="ui header">
    Beethoven Sonatas
  </h2>
...
~~~

Exercise the UX fully again. Make sure the playlist above is being displayed. 

Keep an eye on the shell (console) used to launch the app:

Locate where in the controllers these messages are being generated:

~~~js
...
    Logger.info("Rendering Dashboard");
...
~~~

These logging messages are a useful technique for figuring out what might be going on in an app. There are three variants of the logging statement: `info`, `error` and `debug`. Experiment now with some of these, and exercise the app to make sure the log messages appear.

~~~js
...
    Logger.error("some error has occurred");
...
~~~

~~~js
...
    Logger.debug("some step has occurred...");
...
~~~

Introduce some of the above log statements, and verify that they appear as expected on the console.
