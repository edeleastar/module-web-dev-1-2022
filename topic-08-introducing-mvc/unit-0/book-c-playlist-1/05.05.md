# Playlist Model

The app as we have it now could have been completely built as a static web site. However, the framework and tools we have used in this version enable us to evolve this static site into an interactive app

## Model Classes

We can introduce 'model' classes to implement the playlist in our app. Introduce these two new classes into the `models` package:

## app/models/Song.java

~~~java
package models;

public class Song
{
  public String title;
  public String artist;
  
  public Song(String title, String artist)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.artist = artist;
  }
}
~~~

## app/models/Playlist.java 

~~~java
package models;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Playlist
{
  public String title;
  public List<Song> songs = new ArrayList<Song>();

  public Playlist(String title)
  {
    this.title = title;
  }
}
~~~

## Controller

In the Dashboard controller, we can define a playlist object in Java, add some songs, and send to the view:

~~~java
package controllers;

import models.Playlist;
import models.Song;
import play.Logger;
import play.mvc.Controller;

public class Dashboard extends Controller
{
  public static void index() {
    Logger.info("Rendering Dashboard");
    
    Song s1 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 3", "Beethoven");
    Song s2 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 7", "Beethoven");
    Song s3 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 10", "Beethoven");
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist("Beethoven Sonatas");
    playlist.songs.add (s1);
    playlist.songs.add (s2);
    playlist.songs.add (s3);
    
    render ("dashboard.html", playlist);
  }
}
~~~

## Views

The next step is to eliminate some of the static content from the listsongs partial. Here is a new version to replace the current version:

## views/tags/listsongs.html

~~~html
<table class="ui fixed table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Song</th>
      <th>Artist</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    #{list items:_playlist.songs, as:'song'}
      <tr>
        <td>
          ${song.title}
        </td>
        <td>
          ${song.artist}
        </td>
      </tr>
    #{/list}
  </tbody>
</table>
~~~

In the above, we are `iterating` over an `array` of `songs` inside a `playlist` object

Here is a new version of the dashboard, which will have to pass the playlist to the partial :

## app/views/dashboard.html

~~~
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Dashboard' /}

#{menu id:"dashboard"/}

<section class="ui segment">
  <h2 class="ui header">
    Beethoven Sonatas
  </h2>
  #{listsongs playlist:playlist/}
</section>
~~~

This playlist object, in turn, must be passed to the dashboard controller for this to work. We already did this in the Dashboard conntroller.

Run the app now - and verify that you can see the playlists.
