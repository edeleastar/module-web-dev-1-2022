# Exercises 

## Exercise 1: Download and Rename Sample Solution

A complete version of the app as it should be at the end of this lab:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2020/playlist/releases/tag/playlist-1.end>

Download this, and unzip it. Then, from a shell inside the folder enter:

~~~
play idealize
~~~

... and then open the project. Run the project (using `play run` from the command line) and examine the running program by browsing to:

- <http://localhost:9000>

## Exercise 2: Review Playlist Data Structure

Look again at the playlist as represented in:

~~~java
    Song s1 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 3", "Beethoven");
    Song s2 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 7", "Beethoven");
    Song s3 = new Song("Piano Sonata No. 10", "Beethoven");
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist("Beethoven Sonatas");
    playlist.songs.add (s1);
    playlist.songs.add (s2);
    playlist.songs.add (s3);
    
    render ("dashboard.html", playlist);
~~~

Review the structure carefully. Can you draw a picture of the structure of the data? Add some new songs to the collection and see if they will display in the running application.

## Exercise 3: New Fields

Extend the song model to also have a `duration` field. Change the constructor to initialise this field. Modify the dashboard view to display it. Also include a duration field in the Playlist.

## Exercise 4: Extend Views

Extend the following views:

- Start: Extend the start view to contain a more detailed outline of the purpose of the application. 
- About: Extend the about view to provide contact details (may be fictitious) for the author/company that created the app.
