# Test the Algorithm

The appropriate place to call the algorithm could be just before we display the playlist in the `PlaylistCtrl` index method. It looks like this currently:

### PlaylistCtrl

~~~java
public class PlaylistCtrl extends Controller
{
  public static void index(Long id)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Logger.info ("Playlist id = " + id);
    render("playlist.html", playlist);
  }
  ...
}
~~~

~~~java
public class PlaylistCtrl extends Controller
{
  public static void index(Long id)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Logger.info ("Playlist id = " + id);
    
    Song shortestSong = null;
    if (playlist.songs.size() > 0) {
      shortestSong = playlist.songs.get(0);
      for (Song song : playlist.songs) {
        if (song.duration < shortestSong.duration) {
          shortestSong = song;
        }
      }
    }
    Logger.info("Shortest Song = " + shortestSong.title);
    render("playlist.html", playlist);
  }
~~~

Run this now. It doesn't display anything on the view - however we are logging the shortest song:

~~~bash
08:08:34,457 INFO  ~ Playlist id = 9
08:08:34,485 INFO  ~ Shortest Song = Piano Sonata No. 3
~~~

Visit each of the different playlists and verify that the correct shortest songs is being listed.
