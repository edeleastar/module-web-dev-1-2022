# Develop the Algorithm

Lets first consider an algorithm to find the shortest song. You might be tempted by a google search:

- <https://www.javatpoint.com/java-program-to-print-the-smallest-element-in-an-array>

~~~java
        int [] arr = new int [] {25, 11, 7, 75, 56};  
        //Initialize min with first element of array.  
        int min = arr[0];  
        //Loop through the array  
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {  
            //Compare elements of array with min  
           if(arr[i] <min)  
               min = arr[i];  
        }  
        System.out.println("Smallest element present in given array: " + min);  
~~~

This looks reasonable - however it is an int array, not an ArrayList in the above. However, the approach seems sound - have a look at this:

~~~java
    Song shortestSong = null;
    if (playlist.songs.size() > 0) {
      shortestSong = playlist.songs.get(0);
      for (Song song : playlist.songs) {
        if (song.duration < shortestSong.duration) {
          shortestSong = song;
        }
      }
    }
~~~

We have implemented more or less the same approach :

- Initialise an (empty) object to contain the shortestSong
- Set this to the first song in the array (if there is one)
- Loop through the array until we reach the end
- If we locate any shorter song, set it to shortestSong

Once this algorithm is concluded we have the shortest song.
