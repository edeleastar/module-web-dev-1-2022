# Convenience Feature (optional)

If we are computing a lot of additional metrics for the Playlist, we might keep a copy of the analytics results in the Playlist.

~~~javascript
@Entity
public class Playlist extends Model
{
  public String title;
  @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  public List<Song> songs = new ArrayList<Song>();
  public int duration;

  public String shortestSongTitle;

  public Playlist(String title, int duration)
  {
    this.title = title;
    this.duration = duration;
  }
}
~~~

We have just added `shortestSongTitle` as a string. We will not be loading this from the yaml file - it is just a convenience feature to store the latest metrics.

Our controller can now look like this:

~~~java
  public static void index(Long id)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Logger.info ("Playlist id = " + id);
    playlist.shortestSongTitle = PlaylistAnalytics.getShortestSong(playlist.songs).title;
    render("playlist.html", playlist);
  }
~~~

... and our view 

~~~html
  <h4> Shortest song: ${playlist.shortestSongTitle}</h4>
~~~

The advantage of the above is that our render statement can just pass the playlist:

~~~java
    render("playlist.html", playlist);
~~~

We won't have a (perhaps long) list of parameters appended after playlist. All the information the view needs is accessible form the playlist object.
