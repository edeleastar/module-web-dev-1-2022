# Exercise Solutions

If you have completed the Playlist labs to date, then you can continue to work in the Playlist project you should have created.

If you cannot locate this project, or it has become unusable - then you can start from the solution lab08b:

- <https://github.com/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2020/playlist/releases/tag/playlist.3.end>

Download the archive, unzip and run `play idealize` - and then open in Idea.

## Exercise 2: UX Enhancements

Introduce a 'Delete Playlist' button for each playlist, represented by a `trash` icon. E.g:

![](img/06.png)

In addition, the `view` link is replace by a `folder open` icon.

Bind the `delete playlist` button to a new function to be implemented in the Dashboard controller, which should log the id of the playlist to be deleted.

## Solution

First the new user interface:

### app/views/dashboard.html

~~~html
#{extends 'main.html' /}
#{set title:'Dashboard' /}

#{menu id:"dashboard"/}

#{list items:playlists, as:'playlist'}
  <section class="ui segment">
    <h2 class="ui header">
      ${playlist.title} 
    </h2>
      <p> Total Duration: ${playlist.duration} </p>
      <a href="/playlists/${playlist.id}" class="ui icon button">
        <i class="icon folder open"></i>
      </a>
      <a href="/dashboard/deleteplaylist/${playlist.id}" class="ui icon button">
        <i class="icon trash"></i>
      </a>
  </section>
#{/list}
~~~

## Exercise 3: Delete Playlist Functionality

Now, make the button actually delete the denoted playlist.

## Solution

### conf/routes

~~~bash
GET     /dashboard/deleteplaylist/{id}          Dashboard.deletePlaylist
~~~

### app/controllers/Dashboard.java

~~~java
...
  public static void deletePlaylist (Long id)
  {
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    Logger.info ("Removing" + playlist.title);
    playlist.delete();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }
...  
~~~

Try this now - and make sure a playlist is being deleted.

Also - check to see if the songs in the playlist are also deleted?
