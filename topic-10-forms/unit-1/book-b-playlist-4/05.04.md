# Add Playlist Route + Action

To implement the feature - we need a new route:

## conf/routes

~~~bash
...
POST    /dashboard/addplaylist                 Dashboard.addPlaylist
...
~~~

Finally, the actual implementation of the add playlist logic:

## app/controllers/Dashboard.java

~~~java
...
  public static void addPlaylist (String title)
  {
    Playlist playlist = new Playlist (title, 0);
    Logger.info ("Adding a new playlist called " + title);
    playlist.save();
    redirect ("/dashboard");
  }
...
~~~

Restart the app now - and verify that you can add playlists. Check in the database to verify that the new playlists appear in the table. Also add some songs to the playlist.
