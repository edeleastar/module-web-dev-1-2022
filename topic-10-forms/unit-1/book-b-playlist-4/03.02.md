# Add Song Route + Action

To implement the feature - we need a new route:


## conf/routes

~~~bash
...
POST    /playlists/{id}/addsong                  PlaylistCtrl.addSong
...
~~~

Put this below the existing playlist routes.

Finally, the actual implementation of the add the song - a new method in the Playlist Controler:

## app/controllers/PlaylistCtrl.java

~~~java
...
  public static void addSong(Long id, String title, String artist, int duration)
  {
    Song song = new Song(title, artist, duration);
    Playlist playlist = Playlist.findById(id);
    playlist.songs.add(song);
    playlist.save();
    redirect ("/playlists/" + id);
  }
...
~~~

Restart the app now - and verify that you can add songs. Check in the database to verify that the new songs appear in the table.
