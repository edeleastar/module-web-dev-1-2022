# Exercise 1: Yaml + Bootatrap

Using a new yaml file, which you create in the `conf` folder - seed the database with 3 todo items. The yaml file is usually called `data.yml`. Here is an example of a single todo item:

~~~yaml
Todo(t1):
  title: Make tea
~~~

Remember, you will need to introduce the bootstrap class into the project:

~~~java
import java.util.List;

import play.*;
import play.jobs.*;
import play.test.*;

import models.*;

@OnApplicationStart
public class Bootstrap extends Job 
{ 
  public void doJob()
  {
    Fixtures.loadModels("data.yml");
  }
}
~~~

This must be created in the app folder of the project

This is covered in detail in Lab08a:

- [Create Bootstrap class](https://wit-hdip-comp-sci-2019.github.io/web-development/topic-08-introducing-mvc/unit-1/book-a-playlist-2/index.html#/03)

To see if this works as expected - stop the app (Ctrl+C in the console that started the app) - and re start it. This time it should display the todo items loaded from the yaml file.

Try adding a few more, but remember, this is loaded just once on application startup. So they will not appear until you restart the app again.
