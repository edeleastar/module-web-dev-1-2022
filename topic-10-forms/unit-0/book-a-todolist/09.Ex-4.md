# Exercise 4: Delete Implementation

Introduce the following route into the application:

## conf/routes.html

~~~bash
GET     /dashboard/deletetodo/{id}              Dashboard.deleteTodo
~~~

In the view, we can implement the `href` for the button:

~~~html
...
        <td> <a href="/dashboard/deletetodo/${todo.id} " class="ui tiny red button"> Delete </a> </td>
...        
~~~

This requires this method in the Dashboard controller

~~~html
  public static void deleteTodo(Long id)
  {
    // Implementation here...
    // ...
    redirect("/dashboard");
  }
~~~


How would you go about deleting the todo item from the application model? Some hints below (it is not that hard!)

### Hints

To find a todo in the database:

~~~java
    Todo todo = Todo.findById(id);
~~~

To remove some object from the database:

~~~java
   obj.delete();
~~~
